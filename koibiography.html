          <div class="t1">
            <br>**Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), the Last and Final Messenger of Allah.
            <br>** The Prophet (pbuh) lived his life according to Allah's Guidance (Quran- the Last and Final revelation) and set an example for us to follow until the Last-Day.
            <br>** The Prophet (pbuh) was the perfect slave and worshipper of Allah. And in him we find the best and only example to follow. 
            <br>** All other earlier prophets (and messengers) were sent to certain people, their message and example they set were for a certain period of time. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was sent to everyone and until the Last-Day. 
            <br>**The coming of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) with final revelation (Quran) invalidated all other earlier revelations. Even though we are to believe in the existence of those revelations, in no way we are to follow those revelations or follow the examples and teachings found in those.
            <br>** It is important to understand that we are required to believe in the earlier prophets (and messengers) and the revelations, but we are required to follow only Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and the Final revelation (Quran).
            <br>**Therefore it is very important for all of us to know about the life of the Prophet (pbuh). How else will we follow in his footsteps to draw close to Allah? Through his biography and his Sunnah ('his way' -recorded in Hadith collections) we get to know the greatest man ever lived and set an example for all of us to follow. 
            <br><br><div class="hd2">**It is very important to know the Sirah (biography) from authentic sources only, otherwise we will be learning of things the Prophet (saws) never did/said/approved and thus will be misguided instead of guided.</div>
         </div>    
         <br><br><div class="hd1">A brief outline of Prophet Muhammad's (pbuh) biography (Sirah)</div>
        
         <div class="t1"><br>** Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) left his second wife Hagar and son Ismail (Ishmael) all alone in a barren desert by the order of Allah. Allah sprung up a water well (known as Zamzam) there, which enabled them to survive and eventually others came there, which is known as city of Makkah today. 
            Later on prophet Ibrahim visited them few times. Prophet Ibrahim and Ismail together built a house of worship there by the order of Allah, which is known as Kabah. Prophet Ismail and his progeny lived there since then.
            <br>** Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is a descendent of prophet Ibrahim through the line of prophet Ismail.
            <br>** It is most popularly believed that he was born in 9th or 12th of Rabiul-Awwal (third month of Islamic calendar) in 570 or 571 CE, in the city of Makkah in the Arabian Peninsula, part of modern-day Saudi Arabia.
            <br>** His two most common names are Muhammad and Ahmad. He was named Muhammad by his grandfather.
            <br>** His Father Abdullah bin Abdul-Muttalib died before his birth. His mother Aminah died when he was six years old.
            <br>**He was under the care of his grandfather Abdul-Muttalib and after the death of his grandfather at age eight he was under the care of his paternal uncle Abu Talib.
            <br>** In his early years he was a shepherd and later on he learned the art of trading. As a young man he was often hired by people to trade for them and was well known for his trading skills, honesty and integrity.
            <br>** He was well known among the people of Makkah for his manners and was referred to as 'As-Sadiq' (The Truthful One) and 'Al-Amin' (The Trustworthy One).
            <br>** He married Khadijah, upon a proposal from her when he was 25 years old. At that time Khadijah was a divorcee and widow (from her two previous marriages) and mother of three children and was 15 years older than him. They were together for 25 years until her death and had 6 children of whom 4 survived.
            <br>** He was deeply concerned about the situations surrounding him in Makkah. Idol worship, drinking, gambling, unlimited spouses, infanticide due to poverty, ill treatment of women, killing of female child for false sense of honor and constant fighting between tribes were the norms in that society.
            <br>** When he was forty years old, he received the first revelation (5 verses of the Quran) from Allah, which was brought to him by angel Jibril (Gabriel), in the month of Ramadhan around 610CE. His mission as Prophet and Messenger officially began at that moment. Revelation of Quran would continue for the next 23 years until his death.
            <br>** The Makkans (people of Makkah) vehemently opposed his message of worship of Allah alone and his messengership.
            <br>** For the first three years he was secretly calling people to Islam. His wife Khadijah was the very first person, Abu-Bakr was first man and Ali was the first adolescent to accept Islam. Muslim reverts (or converts) of this period were few and went through extreme torture, persecution and death.
            <br>**For the next 10 years, he was calling people openly to Islam. Which enraged the Makkan polytheists, and their torture and persecution intensified many folds. Numbers of reverts kept increasing in this period and message of Islam spread into surrounding cities.
            <br>**Makkan Polytheists tried everything to destroy Islam and the Prophet (pbuh). They falsely accused him of being a liar, magician and a poet. They tried to lure him with wealth, women and position of leadership. They tried to compromise. Then came the boycott and physical assaults and threat of murder. 
            <br>** In the sixth year of his prophecy the conversion of Hamzah and Umar ( two prominent Makkans) brought some relief and strength to the growing number of Muslim minority.
            <br>** After the death of his uncle Abu Talib (a prominent leader) and his wife Khadijah on the tenth year of his prophecy, the polytheist Makkans started the preparation to Assassinate him and crush the growing movement.
            <br>** During the next three years (from 11th to 13th) the miracle of 'Nocturnal journey to Jerusalem' and 'ascension to heaven and return' took place; and the order of 5 obligatory daily prayers were given by Allah. In this period some people from Madinah came to the Prophet and reverted to Islam. 
            <br>** Number of Muslims were growing in Madinah and in the thirteenth year of his prophecy a group of Muslims from Madinah came and invited him to come to Madinah. They (Muslims and non-Muslims) also offered him protection and leadership of Madinah.
            <br>** Gradual revelation of Quran continued in this period. Whenever revelation came to the Prophet (pbuh) , he would memorize it, teach others and would have it written down by the scribes. Revelations during the first 13 years of his prophecy dealt with pure worship of Allah alone (Tawhid), fundamental beliefs (Aqidah), morality, 
            and stories of the prophets and previous generations.
            <br>** Finally, after 13 years of calling people to Islam in Makkah, Allah ordered the Prophet (pbuh) and the Muslims to migrate (known as Hijrah) to Madinah. Makkan polytheists plotted a huge plan to assassinate him. Allah informed the Prophet (pbuh) and he escaped in the darkness of night, foiling their final attempt on his life and moved to Madinah in 622/623CE.
            <br>** In the first year after Hijrah (migration to Madinah) he began a new chapter of his mission in Madinah. The first thing he did in Madinah was to build a mosque (masjid) and open call for prayer (Adhan) was initiated. 
            <br>** As the leader of Madinah he was dealing with the Muslims, polytheists and the Jews. He immediately began to work on formulizing a constitution which came to be known as the “Constitution of Madinah". In this period permission to resist and fight evil was granted by Allah.
            <br>**In the first two years after the Hijrah number of Muslim converts continued to rise steadily. Qiblah (direction of prayer) was changed from Jerusalem to Makkah (to the direction of Kabah) and fasting in Ramadhan was made obligatory for Muslims by the order of Allah.
            <br>**The steady rise of growing number and power of Muslims worried the Makkans. So, they launched an attack (known as Battle of Badr) on the Muslims two years after the Prophet (pbuh) migrated to Madinah. This was a major event in which the small (around 300 men) Muslim army defeated a powerful Makkan army (around 1000 armed soldiers) against all odds. 
            This victory dealt a heavy blow to the polytheists of entire Arabia and earned recognition of the new Muslim state in Madinah.
            <br>**In the third year after Hijrah, Allah made Zakat obligatory upon Muslims. The Makkan Polytheists would come back this year with a larger army (with the help of neighboring cities) of three thousand to crush the new Muslim state. Prophet (pbuh) was able to manage about thousand Muslims to confront them what is known as the battle of Uhud.
             There were casualties on both sides and neither side own a decisive victory. This gave a moral boost to the enemies of Islam both inside and outside of Madinah.
            <br>** In the fifth year after Hijrah, Makkans would come back with a much bigger army of around ten thousand, aided by the help from surrounding cities in Arabia and the hypocrites and Jews of Madinah. This large force would surround Madinah from all sides. The Prophet (pbuh) only had around 3000 able Muslim men to fight and defend the city. 
            Muslims dug trenches all around Madinah and fought a long hard battle from within, which in known as "Battle of Khandaq" (or Battle of Confederates). After a long hard battle Muslims won decisively when the enemies left. This battle proved the Muslims were ready to confront any enemy no matter how huge they were and cemented the power of the new Muslim state in Madinah. 
            <br>** In the sixth after Hijrah, Prophet (pbuh) and his companions left for Makkah intending to perform Umrah (the lesser Pilgrimage). But they were intercepted (against the prevailing norms of Arabia) before reaching Makkah and were forced to turn back with a treaty known as "treaty of Hudaybiyah".
            <br>** The "treaty of Hudaybiyah" seemed one sided and favoring the Polytheists of Makkah. But the Prophet (pbuh) was content with it as it at least guaranteed peace for next ten years. The Prophet (pbuh) had time finally to focus on the new state and the spread of Islam beyond the boundaries of Arabia. 
            This helped Islam spread faster and large number of non-Muslims were converting to Islam. 
            <br>** Late in the sixth year after Hijrah, the Prophet (pbuh) sent messages to the kings in Arabia and beyond such as king of Ethiopia, Egypt, Persia, Rome, etc., calling them to Islam.
            <br>**In the eight year after Hijrah, Prophet (pbuh) was able to conquer Makkah without bloodshed. And instead of revenge he declared general amnesty. He immediately removed all idols and images from the Kabah, purified it and restored Makkah's sanctity and announced that it was not to be violated thereafter. 
            The Muslims were finally in control of all affairs (religious and political) in Arabia.
            <br>**In the ninth year after Hijrah, Allah made Hajj obligatory for Muslims. Prophet (pbuh) sent a group of several hundred Muslims lead by Abu-bakr to perform Hajj that year for the first time. During this Hajj Allah revealed verses prohibiting all non-Islamic and pre-Islamic practices in and around Kabah and in Makkah.
            <br>**In the tenth year after Hijrah, the Prophet (pbuh) performed Hajj with a great number of Muslims along with him. There he delivered a sermon explaining many important principles of Islam. This is known as "Farewell Pilgrimage" as this was his only and last Hajj.
            <br>** In the eleventh year after Hijrah, the prophet (pbuh) fell ill, and was sick for about ten days and died on 12th of Rabiul-Awwal at the age of 63. 
            <br>** Last verses of the Quran were revealed few days before his death. Revelations during the last 10 years of his prophecy dealt mostly with laws of governing Islamic state and its subjects in every aspect of life and also dealt with perfection of some ritual worship.
            <br>**At his death he left behind the Quran and his Sunnah (recorded in Hadith collections) and a group of companions (knows as Sahabah, most of whom were converts), who took the message of Islam far beyond the boundaries of Arabia to Asia, Africa and Europe within the next 100 years.
