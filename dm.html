        <br>THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF PAMPHLETS IN THIS PAGE
        <br>(1) Gereral dawah pamphlets and (2) Issue specific pamphlets.
       

      
       </div><br>
             <div class="hd1">TYPE ONE: GENERAL DAWAH PAMPHLET</div>  
        <div class="t1">
            <br> As part or dawah material please hand out one of each to every sister/brother of our humanity. Everyone gets these 2 pamphlets whether it is a street dawah, dawah table or stall, or when someone ask you about information on Islam.
            <br>* 1. Short Introduction To Islam.
             <br>* 2. Short Introduction To The Quran.
            

        </div>
        <br> <div class="hd1">TYPE TWO: SOME ISSUE SPECIFIC PAMPHLETS</div>  
        <div class="t1">
         <br>These pamphlets should never be distributed just by itself. These should always be given in addition to the two above general pamphlets. These type of pamphlets should be used in response to a specific enquiry on certain topic. 
            Always good to have some of these handy while on dawah activity or outing.
        <br>~ Frequently asked questions about Islam and Muslims. (This pamphlet is not available yet, we are working on it.)
        <br>~ Misconceptions about Islam and Muslims. (This pamphlet is not available yet, we are working on it.)
        <br>~ And many more to come.

            <br><font color="blue">STEP ONE</font>
         <br><b>ENGLISH VERSION</b>

            •  Short Introduction to Islam: (i) Pdf version
            •  Short Introduction to the Quran: (i) Pdf version
            <br><b>SPANISH VERSION</b>

            •  Short Introduction to Islam: (i) Pdf version
            •  Short Introduction to the Quran: (i) Pdf version
            <br><b>PORTUGUESE VERSION</b>

            •  Short Introduction to Islam: (i) Pdf version
            •  Short Introduction to the Quran: (i) Pdf version

            <br><br><font color="blue">STEP TWO</font>

        <br>~ Print pamphlet using a laser printer on color paper. We recommend 'Garden spring green' (light green) color for short introduction to Islam and 'Goldenrod' (golden or dark yellow) color for short introduction to the Quran.
        <br>~ Search the internet to get good prices on color paper. For example: We use www.shoplet.com (goldenrod color paper Item #UNV11205 and garden springs green color paper Item #CASMP2201GS) and one ream (500 sheets) cost around $5 to $7.
        <br>~ If you already have a laser printer look for cheap compatible ink on internet (do not by brand name original ink). For most laser printer a compatible ink that will give you 4000 to 5000 pages will cost you no more than $25. 
            For example: We use www.amazon.com for our HP laserjet 2200D and 4050N and paid from $10 to $25 for compatible generic ink and they work great. If you are going to buy a laser printer first make sure compatible cheap generic ink available for that printer.
