       <br>
       <div class="hd1">Intention and Sincerity</div>  
    <div class="t1">
      <br> 1. First and most important thing is to remember at all times, our intention to do dawah is only for the sake of Allah. If our intention is to show-off or please someone else , all our efforts will be for nothing but hellfire. As Prophet (pbuh) said, "The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended-- "(Bukhari #1)
      <br>  2. Remember to be sincere as we love our fellow sisters/brothers in humanity and we want the best for them. We don't want our friends, classmates, teachers, colleagues and neighbors to be in Jahannam. We always have to have genuine love and concern for them. Love as you want to be loved.

  </div>
  <br>
      <div class="hd1">Knowledge</div>  
       <div class="t1">  <br>  1. We must have sound knowledge of what we are inviting people to. Mastery of knowledge on Allah's existence, oneness and uniqueness is a must for all caller.
        <br> 2. Knowledge of Quran and about the life of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) are also prerequisites.
        <br> 3. This doesn't mean we have to know everything about Islam before we start inviting people to Islam. Everyone invites according to their knowledge and capacity. If you don't know much, to the very least handout a pamphlet about Islam and or direct someone where to get information about Islam.
        <br>  4. Do not compromise, negotiate or sugar quote when it comes to fundamentals of Islam. Remember we invite to the Truth i.e. Islam.
        <br>  5. Most importantly beware of speaking about Allah and Islam without knowledge. Do not make-up or twist information to suite your needs to win over converts or an argument. If you don't know about something say 'I do not know' or 'Allah knows best'.
        <br>  6. Finally remember Allah said in Quran, "Say (O Muhammad SAW): "This is my way; I invite unto Allah (i.e. to the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me (also must invite others to Allah i.e. to the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge.--"(Surah 12:108).
        
        
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="hd1">Manners</div>  
     <div class="t1"><br>  1. Remember we are to invite people to Allah i.e. Islam. Invite in the best manner possible specially when we are acting as the representative of Allah.
        <br>  2. Be gentle, be polite i.e. be Muslim. Anything less our invitation will not be accepted. Imagine someone ask us to join a party in a careless or impolite manner. Invite as you want to be invited.
        <br>  3. Always start with a greeting and smile and end with thank and greeting. Exchange handshakes (if same gender), names and contact information. Make your invitation as personal as possible. Do your best to connect with the individual. Greet as you want to be greeted.
        <br>  4. No matter what the situation is don't be rude or arrogant. Do not argue or fight. All these qualities will ruin our dawah effort. If situation calls for, be firm back away and contact law-enforcement if necessary. Treat them better than you are treated.
        <br>  5. Finally remember,
        <br> (i) Allah said to prophet Muhammad (pbuh), " And by the Mercy of Allah, you dealt with them gently. And had you been severe and harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about you; so pass over (their faults), and ask (Allah's) Forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affairs..."(Surah 3:159). Also Allah said to Prophet Musa and Harun, "Go, both of you, to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed (all bounds). And speak to him with gentle speech that perhaps he may be reminded or fear [ Allah ]." (Surah 20:43-44).
        <br> (ii) Prophet (pbuh) said, "Allah is Gentle and loves gentleness, and He grants reward for it that He does not grant for harshness."(Abi Dawud, Ibn-Majah, Muslim). Prophet (pbuh) also said," One deprived of gentleness is deprived of good."(Muslim). He also said," Kindness is not to be found in anything but that it adds to its beauty and it is not withdrawn from anything but it makes it defective." (Muslim).
        
      
     </div>
    <br>
    <div class="hd1">Wisdom</div>  
     <div class="t1"><br>  1. Remember to invite people with wisdom. As Allah said, "Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom..." (Surah 16:125).
        <br>  2. Learn different methods and styles of inviting people. Prioritize your information according to its importance. Don't bore people with unnecessary details. Use humor if possible.
        <br>  3. Remember 'one size fits all' approach may not always work. Refine your invitation approach and material according to the need of your people.
        <br>  4. Remember to do your homework before you invite. Get to know your client. Prepare your dawah material ahead of time. Deliver your material in a way they understand. Speak the you want to be spoken to.
        <br>  5. Remember to observe and learn. Specially learn from your mistakes. And try not to make the same mistake again and again.
        
    
     </div>
     <br>
      <div class="hd1">Morality</div>  
            <div class="t1"><br>  1. Be Muslim be of good moral character. Your dawah means nothing if you yourself don't live by what you preach.
                <br>  2. Remember to live by closely following Quran and Sunnah of the Prophet (pbuh). As Allah said, "Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad SAW) you have a good example to follow..."(Surah 33:21).
                <br>  3. Most importantly the way you live your life and conduct yourself is one the most effective way of dawah.
                
  
       </div>
       <br>
       <div class="hd1">Patience and Perseverance (Sabr)</div>  
        <div class="t1"><br>  1. Remember you will face difficulties and hardships along the way. It is a thorny road. Your invitation will be denied, mocked, and at times you will be physically and financially harmed. During this time stay spiritually strong by having Sabr. Referring to Prophet (pbuh) Allah said, "And indeed (many) Messengers were mocked before you..." (Surah 6:10). And Allah Said, "Verily, (many) Messengers were denied before you (O Muhammad SAW), but with Sabr they bore the denial, and they were hurt, till Our Help reached them.." (Surah 6:34).
            <br>  2. Remember your role and goal, is to invite. Our job is to invite not to Guide. Guidance is upon Allah based on wanting of the individual. As Allah said, "......Allah chooses for Himself whom He wills, and guides unto Himself who turns to Him in repentance and in obedience." (Surah 42:13)
            <br>  3. Remember never to give up. Have Sabr and knock (invite) on the same door(individual) again and (after sometime) again and someday it may open. We get the reward from Allah for calling people to Allah i.e. Islam and having Sabr.
            
         
       </div>
       <br>
       <div class="hd1">A Good First Impression</div>  
        <div class="t1"><br>  1. A good first impression is critical for dawah. It is how an individual will perceive you throughout your conversation and in the future meeting.
            <br>  2. Be Muslim be clean. Be muslim smell good. Be muslim brush often and avoid bad breath. Imagine someone with bad smell or bad breath in front of you trying to tell you something.
            <br>  3. Dress well with what you have for the occasion. It is a good idea to dress as close as possible to the norm of the community without violating Islamic dress code. This will help an individual something to identify with you before you utter the first word.
            <br>  4. Most importantly SMILE, SMILE AND SMILE some more. Smile is the ice breaker in starting a conversation with a stranger.
