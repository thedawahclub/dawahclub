        <br><br> <font color="blue">Evidences From Quran And Hadith</font>
       
          <div class="t1">
            <font color="blue">** Evidence from Quran:(1)</font>
            Allah (swt) said (referring to Prophet Muhammad-pbuh), "Say , "This is my way; I invite to Allah with insight (sure knowledge), I and those who follow me. And exalted is Allah ; and I am not of those who associate others with Him."(surat Yusuf 12:108).
            <br><font color="blue">** Evidence from Quran:(2)</font>
            Allah (swt) said, "And who is better in speech than one who invites to Allah and does righteousness and says, "Indeed, I am of the Muslims."(Surat Fussilat 41:33).

            <br> <font color="blue">** Evidence from Quran:(3)</font>
            Allah (SWT) said," Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided.(Surat al-naḥl 16:125).
            <br><font color="blue">** Evidence from Quran:(4)</font>
            Allah (swt) said, "And never let them avert you from the verses of Allah after they have been revealed to you. And invite [people] to your Lord. And never be of those who associate others with Allah ." (Surat al Qasas 28:87).
            <br><font color="blue">** Evidence from Quran:(5)</font>
            Allah (swt) said, "And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful." (surat Aal-Imran 3:104).
            <br> <font color="blue">** Evidence from Quran:(6)</font>
            Allah (swt) said, "Indeed, those who conceal what We sent down of clear proofs and guidance after We made it clear for the people in the Scripture - those are cursed by Allah and cursed by those who curse."(Surat Al-Baqarah 2:159).
            <br><font color="blue">** Evidence from Quran:(7)</font>
            Allah (swt) said, "So unto this [religion of Allah ] invite, [O Muhammad], and stand straight (on this path) as you are commanded.." (Surah As-Shuraah 42:15).
            <br><font color="blue"> ** Evidence from Quran:(8)</font>
            Allah (swt) honored muslims (followers of the last Messenger (pbuh)) saying, "You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah...." (Surat Aal-Imran 3:110)
            <br><font color="blue">** Evidence from Quran:(9)</font>
            Allah (swt) ordered His final messenger Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) , "O Messenger, announce that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, and if you do not, then you have not conveyed His message..." ( Surat al-Maidah 5:67).
            <br><font color="blue"> ** Evidence form Hadith (1)</font>
            Narrated Abdullah bin Amr, The Prophet said, "Convey (my teachings) to the people even if it were a single sentence (verse), and tell others the stories of Bani Israel (which have been taught to you), for it is not sinful to do so. And whoever tells a lie on me intentionally, will surely take his place in the (Hell) Fire." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, vol. 4, p. 442, no. 667)
            <br><font color="blue">** Evidence form Hadith (2)</font>
            Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakra's father, The Prophet said,".....It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform those who are absent because those who are absent might comprehend (what I have said) better than the present audience." (Sahih al-Bukhari #67, In-book reference: Book 3, Hadith 9)
            <br> <font color="blue">** Evidence form Hadith (3)</font>
            The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls others to guidance will have a reward like the rewards of those who follow him, without that detracting from their reward in any way. And whoever calls others to misguidance will have a burden of sin like the burden of those who follow him, without that detracting from their burden in any way.”(Narrated by Muslim, 2674)
            <br> <font color="blue">** Evidence form Hadith (4)</font>
            The prophet (pbuh) said “For Allaah to guide someone by your hand is better for you than having red camels.” (Bukhari hadith 3009, vol-4 page-156)
            <br> <font color="blue">AN IMPORTANT POINT TO REMEMBER:</font>
            THERE WILL BE NO MORE PROPHET OR MESSENGER AFTER PROPHET MUHAMMAD (PBUH) AND AS HIS UMMAH (FOLLOWER), THE BEST OF MANKIND AS ALLAH (SWT) HONORED US IN QURAN, WE BECAME THE INHERITORS OF ANNOUNCING THE MESSAGE OF ISLAM, AN HONOR AND RESPONSIBILITY ONLY GIVEN TO THE FOLLOWERS OF THE LAST AND FINAL MESSENGER PROPHET MUHAMMAD (PBUH).                                                                                            
            <br><br> <font color="blue">IN CONCLUSION:</font> It is well known that all the Ullima agree that dawah is an obligation and responsibility upon the Muslim Ummah. There is difference of opinion whether it is Fard 'Ayn (obligatory upon every Muslim) or Fard Kifaayah (which is a collective responsibility upon the Muslim ummah, if it is done by some of the ummah other are free from this obligation). 
            But in our time with the great need for dawah and not enough people doing it all Ullima agree that it is obligation on every Muslims to do dawah in some form.
        </div>
        <br><br><div class="hd1">WHO DOES DAWAH</div>
        <div class="hd2">Every Muslim man and woman, young and old.</div>
        <font color="blue">We need to remember that we get to live once in preparation for the life of eternity</font>
        <div class="t1">As Allah (swt) said in Quran, (1)By Al-'Asr (the time). (2) Verily! Man is in loss, (3) Except those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al-Ma'ruf) which Allah has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al-Munkar) which Allah has forbidden], 
        and recommend one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allah's Cause during preaching His religion of Islamic Monotheism or Jihad, etc.). (surah al-Asr 103).
        <br>** SO, there are four conditional characteristics that man/woman must have in order to be saved from eternal loss. These are:
        <br>  (1) BELIEVE +
        <br>(2) DO RIGHTEOUS GOOD DEEDS +
        <br>(3) ADVICE/RECOMMEND ONE ANOTHER TO THE TRUTH (Allah, Islam, good deeds etc.) +
        <br>(4) HAVE PATIENCE/PERSEVERANCE (while preaching the truth).

         <br><br><div class="hd1">HOW TO DO DAWAH</div>
