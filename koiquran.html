       <div class="hd1">THE QURAN</div>
       <div class="hd2"><font color="blue">THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF ISLAMIC INFORMATION</font>
        <br>**The Quran is the Last and Final Revelation from Allah.
        <br>**The Quran is a complete guide covering all aspects of our life.
        <br>**The Quran is the inimitable and unique Arabic Speech or Word of Allah revealed orally to Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) by angel Gabriel in wording and meaning, which has been preserved in memory (by memorization) and in writing and reached us by numerous authentic continuous (mutawatir) transmissions.

      
       </div><br>
             <div class="hd1">**BRIEF HISTORY**</div>  
          <div class="t1">
            <br>* The entire Quran was revealed to prophet Muhammad (pbuh) gradually over 23 years.This revelation began in one night known as the Night of Decree (Laylat Al-Qadr) in the month of Ramadan (9th month of Islamic calendar) when Prophet Muhammad was about 40 years old and ended with his death at age sixty three.
            <br>* During the Prophet's (pbuh) lifetimethe entire Quran was memorized by many companions, written down in different materials and kept in secured possession of the Prophet and other prominent companions.
            <br>* Immediately after the Prophet's (pbuh) death (632/633 CE) Abu Baker (leader of the believers) gathered all of the main scribes, huffaz (memorizer of Quran), all written materials of the Quran, and had it written down on parchment and made a single volume which was correct, authentic and complete.
            <br>* During Uthman's Caliphate, Uthman in consultation with other prominent companions of the Prophet decided to make several official copies from the single volume using the same methodology that was used by Abu Baker. Uthman then sent these official copies along with an expert 
            companion to each Muslim province and ordered to destroy all other unofficial, partial and personal Quranic materials.
            <br>* Quran we use today in all over the world are made from those copies. Unlike other scriptures that were changed with human interpolations and omissions, the Quran has remained unchanged and will remain so as Allah Himself has guaranteed its preservation and protection.
            <br>** The Quran is only available in Arabic, its original language. The Quran’s beauty, style, miraculous nature and its message can only be understood in full extent by understanding Arabic. But for the benefit of the non-Arabs the meaning of the Quran has been translated in many languages.**

        </div>
        <br><br><div class="hd1">**SOME IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT THE QURAN**</div>
        
        <div class="t1">
            <br>* The Quran has 114 chapters (Surahs) which have more than 6000 verses. Surahs within Quran are not organized in the chronological sequence of their revelation. In some cases verses within a surah are not organized in the chronological order of their revelation. 
            The order of the verses within a surah and the order of the surahs within the Quran were revealed from Allah.
            <br>* The word Quran means reading or recitation indicating the fact that the Quran is to be both recited from memory and read from text. All Muslims have to memorize some parts of the Quran and there are many who have memorized the entire Quran. 
            <br>* The Quran’s fundamental message is to submit to Allah and worship Him alone. As a complete guide, it covers all aspects of life. Examples of some topics in the Quran include the following but are not limited to: defining the creed; expounding moral instruction; admonishing believers and non- believers; 
            inviting people to explore, question and validate the truth it proclaims; giving good news of afterlife; laying down laws from dealing with mundane matters of daily lives to matters of warfare; drawing lessons from historical events etc.
            <br>* Verses (and Surahs) revealed before Prophet Muhammad's (pbuh) migration known as Hijra to Madina are known as Makki, and those revealed after migration (Hijra) to Madina are known as Madani (with few exceptions).
            <br>* The Quran is a unique book. Its theme, style, order, and arrangement of information is unlike any other book. Readers are likely to notice that diverse kinds of materials exist side by side. It may seem confusing to a new reader as it will navigate through different topics and at times may seem to change from on topic to another without any notice or indication.
            <br>* The Quran does not relate history in a conventional sense. The Quran narrates many narratives in brief and at times in details including stories of previous Prophets. Whenever the Quran brings up a snap shot of history, it is for a reason. That reason may be correcting what was related in other religious books, or to teach a lesson, or show an example.
            <br>* The Quran is not a book of science but it relates signs for the curious and hungry mind to contemplate. One may find many signs indicating well established scientific facts like embryology, origin of universe, earth's shape, earth and suns rotation, expansion of the universe, every living being made of water and many others. 
            No established scientific fact is ever in disagreement with the signs related in the Quran.
            <br>* In the Quran, God at times refers to Himself in 1st person, third person (he) and at times 1st person plural (we or us). In Arabic, it is as correct to use the plural when speaking of one person as it is to use the singular. But the plural is used for respect and glorification, and no one is more deserving of respect and glorification than God. 
            So the singular is used to affirm the fact that He is One and has no partner or associate, and the plural is used to affirm His glory and majesty, may He be exalted. 
            <br>* The Quran at times gives details about a topic and at times gives little details about a topic. At times, the background and circumstances under which particular verses containing orders or rules were revealed have not been mentioned. But keep in mind God didn’t just send His final revelation but He sent along with 
            it the final Messenger Prophet Muhammad, who had lived according to that complete guidance and gave us the details of the complete guidance by practice and instruction.
